# Design decisions

## Not all methods from validator.js are supported

Methods were selected considering a combination of the following criteria:
- Does the format have a technical standard?
- Can it be tested by using better suited / specialized modules (e.g. `$date` expressions)?
- Does it solve a common use scenario?
- Does the code use complex RegExps? Complex RegExps require detailed vetting
  to prevent [ReDoS vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).
